//runApp() is the function responsible for running the app.
//The app is represented by the main widget, in this case MyApp instance.\
//Everything in Flutter is called as a widget.
//You compose your app by putting widgets together.

//Stateless widgets: they do not have a fixed or constant state. As they repre-
//sents the app itself they change their appearance often during app execution;
//Without memory;

//Stateful widgets: they have state and it is kept under memory; their state
//matter;

//We can extract parts of the flowing code and put it inside a widget.
//The app extends StatelessWidget, which makes the app itself a widget. 
//In Flutter, almost everything is a widget, including alignment, padding, 
//and layout.

//A widgetâ€™s main job is to provide a build() method that describes how to 
//display the widget in terms of other, lower level widgets.
